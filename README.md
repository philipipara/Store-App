# Store-App

I am creating a mock store application where users can buy MLB jerseys. This application will have protected routes for a few different
items. A protected route where a user would have to be logged in to purchase items, and an admin route where an admin can make changes
to the products on the website. The application is being built by using the MERN stack

Here is a few samples what it looks like so far
